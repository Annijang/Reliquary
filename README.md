Reliquary [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/P3pp3rF1y/Reliquary.svg?branch=1.11.2-dev)](https://drone.io/github.com/P3pp3rF1y/Reliquary/latest)
=========

Description
=========

The offical repository of Reliquary! That mod, with the magical swag, and a weapon, and stuff.

Originally made by x3n0ph0b3 and TheMike, Reliquary is now maintained by P3pp3rF1y.

Building
=========

We use ForgeGradle. There are instructions inside the 'build.gradle' file in this repository.

Versioning
=========

Every major version increase means a Minecraft version increase. 1.1.x is for 1.6.4. 1.2.x is for Minecraft 1.7. 1.3 is for Minecraft 1.8. And so on. 

Licence
=========

The licence is located at COPYING.txt, but to save you the trouble, it's GPLv3 (with one of the sounds under CC Attribution License). 

Basically, do whatever you want, as long as it's free, open source, and stays under GPL. (Yes, that allows you to use it in your modpack.)
