 * Created by Xeno on 10/11/2014.
 * This stores all the "ingredient" items used by the mod that don't actually do anything.
 * Right now I've dumped them all into meta and used the shared name "mob_ingredient" even though
 * they're not all technically mob drops. It was mostly just a way for me to clean up our items folder,
 * and make the creative tabs better organized.
